# Reverse date calculator

The goal of this small app is to calculate an original date, if you only have an end date and a number of years, months and days. It is particularly useful in situations where you have a death date, a number of years / months / days but no birth date. You can also choose to include leap years.

## Note before use

This is a very basic program, that might panic in some circumstances. I might improve it in the future, depending on the success of the tool and depending on raised issues.

## Usage

### Windows

You can get the latest release [here](https://github.com/CPoncet/reverse-date-calculator/releases)

### Other OSes

Feel free to grab the source code and compile it on your machine using rustup. You can open an issue if you need this tool on other OSes and I might produce the releases.
